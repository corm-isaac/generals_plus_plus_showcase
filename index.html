      <p class="setting_box_para">Liberty. Egality. Fraternity. The Nation of France, of equals, for equals, is born. The French
        Revolution has begun, and it's first order is to abolish the idea of total monarchism and birth, and bring the Enlightment Ideals
        into practice. The French Republic is established. <br> <br>
        However, the other reactionary and backward powers of Europe threaten to extinguish our beacon of freedom. Our rivals, the Austrians
        line up on our border, eager to extend the Habsburg influence into France itself and control France from Vienna. <br> <br> The Prussians, alongside the Austrians, issue the 
        Declaration of Pilnitz, a reactionary backhanded policy that seeks to block the establishment of a true, righteous democracy.
        <br><br> The Russian Empire marches from Moscow, and they will not stop until they reach Paris and burn the city into the ground.
        <br><br> The Spanish, from the south, invade from the south, crossing the Pyrenees and are threatening Toulouse. 
        <br><br> The Portuguese, like the British lapdogs they are, harass our sailors and boats on the sea, and combine with other armies
        to further threaten the people of France.
        <br><br> The hated British are back again, determined to destroy every French Army we mobilize, cut us off from our oversea colonies
        interfere with our rightful clay in the Netherlands.
        <br><br>Even in France itself, misguided monarchists and radicals seek to erode the democratic system we have fought so hard to achieve.
        Nobles, the wealthy and Generals flee France to flock pathetically in London.
        <br><br>With the whole of Europe against us, rarely has any nation in history won against these odds. 
        <br><br>But we did. New men stepped up, winning us victories at Valmy, Marengo, and Zurich. From Brest to Nice, Bordeaux to Lille, 
        every Frenchman did his duty. The masses were levied, and the Republic was saved. Viva la France!

      <p class="setting_box_para">1813. France finds herself at war with most of Europe. <br><br>
        The Grand Armee is in tatters from it's disastrous retreat from Moscow. 
        On average, the French Army has lost five out of six men who participated in the inital invasion. 
        <br><br>France's treasury is empty, the Continental System is merely a dream, and the French are pressed from all sides. A so 
        called 'Sixth Coaliton' (after France beat the other five) has been formed, with the British at the helm.
        <br><br>Prussia has defected, and joined the coalition in Feburary, followed by Austria soon after. 
        <br><br>Sweden, led by Marshal Bernadotte, is also at war with the French Empire.
        <br><br>Marshal Murat has fled France to keep what is left of his Kingdom in Naples. 
        <br><br>The states in the former Holy Roman Empire flock to join the Sixth Coaliton.
        <br><br>The Russians are determined to avenge Moscow. The Duchy of Warsaw is the first victim of their warpath.
        <br><br>Only the Confederation of the Rhine and Denmark remained loyal to the French cause, though for how much longer remains to be seen. 
        <br><br>The Peninsular War, or the 'Spanish Ulcer', has reared it's ugly head, sapping both much needed generals, war material and men. 
        <br><br>With the back to the wall, can Napoleon secure one final decisive victory? 
        Or will the Sixth Coalition prove to topple a decade's worth of blood, iron and steel?</p>
